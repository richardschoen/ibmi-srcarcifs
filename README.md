# Copy, Extract or Archive IBM i Source Physical File Members to IFS 
This repo contains self-contained IBM i CL commands for copying source members from a source physical file to a selected IFS structure for backup or archive purposes or for manually committing to a Git repository you may be using in your IFS home directory (```/home/userid```)      

The main use case would be for:
- Poor man's source management. Teams that don't have ANY source control system in place but need a way to quickly make backup copies of source members to the IFS.   
- Consultants or developers who need to export a group of source members for archiving or placing into their own Git development repositories.    
- When working on a source member, instead of going through member copy hell, just create a timestamped archvie copy as a quick backup before and after changes are made to the source members.    

The SRCARCIFS command has the unique ability to:
- Place each library source member that a user takes a snaphost of into the user's home directory under a subdirectory structure as follows: ```/home/user/archivesource/library/file/member```. Each developer's changes can be archived in their home directory or a generic specified command directory such as: ```/archivedsource```.
- Optionally place all source members in a single directory with combined member names unique across libraries with naming pattern of: ```/home/user/library_file_member_date_time.srctype```
- Timestamp the IFS output files. This is the default option for those who want to take snapshots of code to the IFS but don't use Git yet and don't want to worry about accidentally overwriting archived source members. 
- Capture source physical file member metadata info (Originating Source Library,File,Member,Type,Text) for each member to a pipe delimited IFS file ending with ```.metainfo```
Ex source member:
```/home/user/archivesource/qclsrc/mbr01c.clp```
Ex source member metadata:   
```/home/user/archivesource/qclsrc/mbr01c.metainfo```

## Sample Command with all command parameters

This example copies the selected source member TEST001C to the current user's home directory under the archivesource subdirectory.  Subdirectories will be auto-created if they don't exist. We use the top level home directory authority when creating directories. 
Ex output directory: ```/home/userid/archivesoruce/qgpl/qclsrc/

Ex output files created: 
Source member TEST001 captured to TEST001.CLP   
```/home/userid/archivesoruce/qgpl/qclsrc/test001.clp```
Source member TEST001 source file metadata info captured to TEST001.mbrinfo. (Pipe delimited file)   
```/home/userid/archivesoruce/qgpl/qclsrc/test001.mbrinfo```

```
SRCARCIFS SRCFILE(QGPL/QCLSRC            
          SRCMBR(TEST001C)               
          ARCIFSDIR(*HOMEDIR)          
          HOMESUBDIR('archivesource')  
          OUTPUTFMT(*LIBFILEDIR)       
          APPENDTS(*YES)               
          METAINFO(*YES)               
          REPLACE(*NO)                 
          PROMPTSQL(*NO)               
```

## SRCARCIFS command parameters
From source file - SRCFILE - This is the source file where the source members originate from.  

From source member - SRCMBR - This is the source member to be copied/exported/snapshotted to the IFS.   

Archive output IFS directory - ARCIFSDIR - This is the root IFS subdirectory where members will be written to.    

Home subdir if *HOMEDIR set - HOMESUBDIR - If the user specified *HOMEDIR on the ARCIFSDIR parm, this is the subdirectory within the users home directory that gets created. You can name it anything you want.Default value:   Ex: ```/home/userid/archivesource```

Output format - OUTPUTFMT - This is the directory structure and member naming format that will be used when copying source members to the IFS. The subdirectories will get auto-created.

*LIBFILEDIR - Subdirectories are auto-create within the ARCIFSDIR directory for each source library, source file and member name. This structure is similar to the directory structure for source files in the QSYS.LIB file system which is: QSYS.LIB/LIBNAME.LIB/FILENAME.FILE.MEMBER.MBR

*LIBEFILEMBR - All members are written to the single directory name specified in the ARCIFSDIR parameter. Ex: ```/home/user/archivesource```. Each member is named uniquely as follows: ```LIBRARY_FILE_MEMBER.SRCTYPE```. Metadata info name would be like:  ```LIBRARY_FILE_MEMBER.METAINFO``` This should insure each source member across one or more libraries is uniquely named so there should be no naming collisions. Also by default the members are timestamped so the actual file name might be something like: ```LIBRARY_FILE_MEMBER_DATE_TIME.SRCTYPE``` Metadata info name would be like: ```LIBRARY_FILE_MEMBER_DATE_TIME.METAINFO```

Append timestamp to file names

Output .metainfo IFS file - METAINFO - Output a metadata IFS file for the source member. This is a great way to keep Metadata info for each source member exported to the IFS without having to put the metadata info into the source member itself.

Replace existing IFS file - Set this option if you want to overwrite a source member. If you have APPENDTS set to *YES, you can always set this to *NO because a new timestamped IFS file will be written for each member that gets output to the IFS.

Prompt SQL - PROMPTSQL - If you have issues with the metadata export, you can prompt and see the SQL used to create the delimited record output for the source member metadata info.
